# Astro Weight Calculator 

This is a small beginner project I made while learning JavaScript. It's a simple weight calculator that shows how much you would weigh on different planets. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What It Does

You enter your weight on Earth, choose a planet from the dropdown list, and it shows you how much you'd weigh on that planet based on its gravity.

### Why I Made It

This was part of my learning for JavaScript. I wanted to practice things like:

- Selecting elements from the page
- Listening for user actions (like clicking a button)
- Doing some basic math with JavaScript
- Updating text on the page using JavaScript

### How to Use It

1. Open the site in your browser (or open `index.html` from the project files).
2. Type in your weight in the box.
3. Pick a planet.
4. Click the calculate button.
5. Your weight on that planet will show up!

### What I Learned

- How to work with `querySelector()` and events like `click`
- Writing basic functions in JavaScript
- Updating the DOM based on user input
